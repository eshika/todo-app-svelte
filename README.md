# CS 279 Programming HW4

This repo contains the code for a basic To Do App website made with Svelte and Firebase. The main code is stored in src/routes/+page.svelte

On this To Do App website, users can create and complete tasks which are added to a To Do List. This site also has the functionality of being able to delete tasks. The site also displays a counter of the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks. All tasks are stored in a database using Firebase, so the tasks remain on the site even after closing and reopening or refreshing the page.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eshika/todo-app-svelte.git
cd todo-app-svelte
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `localhost:PORT` in your browser of choice (replace port number with the port specified in the output of npm run dev) to view the site.
